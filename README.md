# Zotero Save with Tag

Based on the code of [Zotero MAS MetaData](https://github.com/TobiHol/zotero-mas-metadata)

When you save your items using Zotero Connector, this plugin will automatically tag the new added item with tag "To-Read". 

This plugin is for my personal use, so I don't add the preference setting function. If you want to change the tag name, you can just modify the codes and pack the `.xpi` file by yourself. 

How to create a `.xpi` file?

1. Select the contents of this extension (Important! Not the outside folder!)
2. Zip the contents
3. Change the suffix `.zip` to `.xpi`
